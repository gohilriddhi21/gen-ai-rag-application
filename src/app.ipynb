mood, energy, stress levels, sleep quality, and headaches on an app several times a day for 2 weeks. Morning attacks were more likely in people who had poor sleep overall, poor sleep the night before, or low energy the day before. Afternoon and evening attacks more often struck those who had more stress or significantly higher-than-usual energy levels. The research could lead to a headache-predicting app. In the meantime, you can track sleep, energy, and stress on your own to try to foresee attacks.\\n\\nSOURCE: Neurology\\n\\n# Almost half of people with chronic migraine report feeling stigma about their condition, a new study shows.\\n\\nSome felt that other people saw their migraines as a way to get attention. Others said people tended to dismiss the severity of their condition. The more stigma that migraineurs felt, according to the study, the worse their reported quality of life. The researchers speculated that stigma may have a bigger impact on quality of life than headache does. They suggest that connecting with others who live with migraine could help reduce feelings of stigma.\\n\\nSOURCE: JAMA\\n\\nSOURCE: Neurology\\n\\n# Changes in barometric pressure\\n\\n—the air pressure of the atmosphere—that happen with fluctuations in the weather are a known trigger of migraines and contributor to pain severity. That’s why atmospheric scientists are exploring ways to develop weather forecasting tools that could also predict the risk of a migraine attack or other chronic pain flare based on air pressure. According to their research, people who live with migraine would be extremely likely to change their plans, avoid additional triggers, or take preventive medications in response to a pain-based weather forecast.\\n\\nSOURCE: International Journal of Biometeorology\\n\\nTHIS CONTENT IS CREATED AND CONTROLLED BY WEBMD’S EDITORIAL STAFF | WWW.WEBMD.COM', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=1996, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}')]\n"

Second, the type of pain experienced is different; migraines have pulsating pain, while tension-type headaches have pressing or tightening (nonpulsating) pain. Third, the intensity of the pain can vary, with migraines being moderate to severe, and tension-type headaches being mild to moderate. Fourth, the duration of the headache can also differ, with migraines lasting 4-72 hours, while tension-type headaches can last anywhere from 30 minutes to 7 days. Lastly, the symptoms associated with each headache type are different. For migraines, symptoms include nausea, vomiting, photophobia (sensitivity to light), and phonophobia (sensitivity to sound).
